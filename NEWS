serial 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added `.onAttach()` to attempt to catch older OSX installations with incomplete
    tcltk installations.
* Added `findDevices()` helper function, which should show active serial devices on
    OSX, Linux, and Windows.
* Deprecated `read.serialConnection` and `write.serialConnection` for 
    `read` and `write` generics, and associated "serialConnection" 
    methods. This standardizes the different functions that can act on 
    these objects. Additionally, export a generic version of `write` from the base package.


BUG FIXES AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Import methods, utils, and tcltk.
* Removed `try()` calls in functions to allow easier error handling by the user.
* Removed the `name` argument to `serialConnection()`, because it was not optional
    as stated by the help file and did not seem to serve any purpose.
* Reorganized *.R files.
* Minor refactoring of existing functions.
* Various spelling and grammatical corrections, and documentation improvements.
* Added '-timeout 5000' to `.Tcl` call in `open.serialConnection`. I had an issue
    with OSX hanging and wanted to see if that was the issue.
