Changes since 1.1:

- Removed `try()` calls in functions to allow easier error handling by the user.
- Deprecated `read.serialConnection` and `write.serialConnection` for 
    `read_data` and `write_data` generics, and associated "serialConnection" methods. 
    This standardizes the different functions that can act on these objects.
- Reorganized *.R files.
- Added `find_devices()` helper function, which should show active serial devices on
    OSX, Linux, and Windows.
- Minor refactoring of existing functions.
- Added `.onAttach` to attempt to catch older OSX installations with incomplete
    tcltk installations.
- Started to add unit tests using `testthat`.
- Various spelling and grammatical corrections.
